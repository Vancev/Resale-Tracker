## Resale Tracker

Resale tracker is a web application that helps resellers track their items and profits. 
Sellers are able to enter item information into the app such as:
- item name
- cost
- buy location
- sold location
- shipping costs

The app automatically calculates profits for items sold on ebay, mecari, and locally. Stats such as total profit, ROI, sales per platform are automatically created.

Currently this app only supports calculating profits for Mecari, Ebay, and local platforms without fees.
